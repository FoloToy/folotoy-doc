[Online tool for generating self-hosted server files](https://self-hosting-file-generator.vercel.app/)

This document explains the configuration of `roles.json` and provides some examples for reference. The latest version of the file is available here: [roles.json](https://github.com/FoloToy/folotoy-server-self-hosting/blob/main/config/roles.json)

## Basic Configuration

List of configurable parameters:

| Parameter Name | Description | Default Value |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| start_text | The startup prompt that will be automatically converted into a speech file and sent to the toy (required) | None |
| prompt | Definition of the role's prompts (required) | None |
| max_message_count | Set to a value greater than 0, e.g., change it to 10, to indicate support for 10 dialogues in context. Setting it to 0 means no support for context. Each model has its own limit on the size of context tokens. If exceeded, you can clear the context by pressing the current role button again. You can also roughly limit the context size by adjusting `max_message_count` and `max_tokens` values. | 0 |

### Configuration Example

:::caution

The following configurations can be directly copied and pasted for use.

If you want to remember the context, you can adjust `max_message_count` to the desired number, but it is not recommended to set it too large to exceed the size limit of the large model.

## Advanced Configuration

:::caution

The following is advanced configuration. Please follow the tutorial step by step.

**Note: The following configurations take precedence over those in `docker-compose.yml`.**

The following configurations are for individually configuring STT, LLM, and TTS for each role. They only apply to the configured roles.

:::

| Parameter Name | Description | Default Value |
| --------- | ---- | --------- |
| stt_type | Type of speech-to-text engine | openai-whisper |
| stt_config | Specific configuration of the speech-to-text engine. Different engine types have different configuration parameters. | Depends on the selected `stt_type` |
| llm_type | Type of large language model. You can also use [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) to convert large model interfaces to openai-compatible ones to support more large models. | openai |
| llm_config | Configuration of the large model | Depends on the selected `llm_type` |
| tts_type | Type of text-to-speech engine | openai-tts |
| tts_config | Configuration of the text-to-speech engine | Depends on the selected `tts_type` |
