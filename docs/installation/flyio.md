title: Installing FoloToy Server Program on Fly.io
sidebar_label: Fly.io
---
This article provides the necessary steps to install the FoloToy server program on [Fly.io](https://fly.io).

## Prerequisites

* Register an account on [fly.io](https://fly.io) and link your bank card.
* Prepare an OpenAI API key. You can register for an API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). If you are unable to register for OpenAI, you can also register for the [MagickChat](https://one-api.magickchat.com/) service and obtain a testing API key.

## Getting Started with Installation and Deployment

If you don't have the `git` command installed on your machine, you'll need to install `git` and the `flyctl` command. The entire deployment process requires the use of commands, so it's quite geeky.

* [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Install flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/)

### Obtain the Required Configuration Files for Deployment

Open your terminal. On macOS, you can use the built-in Terminal.app.

```
git clone https://github.com/FoloToy/folotoy-server-self-hosting.git
```

### Modify Configuration Files

Navigate to the directory `./folotoy-server-self-hosting/flyio/folotoy-server`. The files in this directory are as follows:

```
├── flyio
│   └── folotoy-server
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       ├── acl.conf
│       ├── fly.toml
│       ├── mosquitto.conf
│       ├── passwd
│       ├── roles.json
│       ├── set_secrets.sh
│       └── start.sh
```

The files that need to be modified according to your own situation are as follows:

* fly.toml
* passwd

If you want to define the roles of the toys yourself, you can also modify the roles.json file.


#### Modify the `fly.toml` File

Replace all instances of `<your_app_name>` in the `fly.toml` configuration file with your own defined name.

```
# Todo: modify your app name
app = "<your_app_name>"
......
  # Todo: modify your speech udp server host
  SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_HOST = "<your_app_name>.fly.dev"
......
    # Todo: modify your audio files download url
  AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_URL = "http://<your_app_name>.fly.dev:8082"
```
If you have named your application "folotoy-server-test," your fly.toml file should look like this:

```toml
# fly.toml app configuration file generated for folotoy-server-test on 2023-12-13T18:33:02+08:00
#
# See https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/ for information about how to use this file.
#

app = "folotoy-server-test"
primary_region = "nrt"

[build]

[env]
  API_SERVER = "true"
  API_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS = "0.0.0.0"
  API_SERVER_PORT = "8082"
  AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_URL = "http://folotoy-server-test.fly.dev:8082"
  AUDIO_SAVE_PATH = "/audio"
  LLM_TYPE = "openai"
  LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
  LOG_OUTPUT = "stderr"
  MQTT_BROKER_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
  MQTT_BROKER_PORT = "1883"
  MQTT_CLIENT_ID = "folotoy"
  MQTT_USERNAME = "folotoy"
  OPENAI_TTS_MODEL = "tts-1"
  OPENAI_WHISPER_MODEL = "whisper-1"
  ROLES_FILE_PATH = "/config/roles.json"
  SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS = "fly-global-services"
  SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_HOST = "folotoy-server-test.fly.dev"
  SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_PORT = "8085"
  STT_TYPE = "openai-whisper"
  TTS_TYPE = "edge-tts"
  TZ = "Asia/Shanghai"

[[services]]
  protocol = "udp"
  internal_port = 8085

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 8085

[[services]]
  protocol = "tcp"
  internal_port = 8082

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 8082

[[services]]
  protocol = "tcp"
  internal_port = 1883

  [[services.ports]]
    port = 1883

```
#### Modify the passwd file

Add your MQTT service account, toy's SN, and key to the `passwd` file.

* For example, my toy's SN and key are F234103026 and JvRjTtz5brsN, respectively, you can find the SN and key on the packaging. If you don't have them, you can connect the toy to your computer using the provided USB cable and visit [folotoy tool](https://tool.folotoy.com) to retrieve them.
* If you have multiple toys, add a new line for each toy in this file.
* My MQTT service account username and password are folotoy and Ev6****cDB, respectively. Please keep the username as folotoy, and you can choose any string as the password.
* **Note**: The `passwd` file should not contain empty lines, and the last line should not be empty.

For example, here is my passwd file:
```
folotoy:Ev6****cDB
F234103026:JvRjTtz5brsN
```

#### Start executing the flyio command

* fly auth login
* fly launch --ha=false --no-deploy
```
❯ fly launch --ha=false --no-deploy

```

This way, you have created an app. Open the fly.io dashboard in a browser and navigate to the newly created project to add several password configurations that you will need.

Four variables need to be added in total, where `OPENAI_OPENAI_KEY`, `OPENAI_TTS_KEY`, and `OPENAI_WHISPER_KEY` can use the same `apiKey`.

* MQTT_PASSWORD: This password is the same as the one used by the "folotoy" user in the previous `passwd` file. Please keep it consistent.
* OPENAI_OPENAI_KEY: This is the apiKey for OpenAI.
* OPENAI_TTS_KEY: This is the apiKey for OpenAI Text-to-Speech.
* OPENAI_WHISPER_KEY: This is the apiKey for OpenAI Whisper.

You can also create the secrets by modifying the `set_secrets.sh` file in the directory and executing the command `./set_secrets.sh`. The effect is the same as adding them in the Fly.io dashboard. For example, the content of my `set_secrets.sh` file is as follows

```
fly secrets set MQTT_PASSWORD="Ev6****cDB"
fly secrets set OPENAI_OPENAI_KEY="sk-MOfAmt06v*********************uPx33lKL"
fly secrets set OPENAI_TTS_KEY="sk-MOfAmt06v*********************uPx33lKL"
fly secrets set OPENAI_WHISPER_KEY="sk-MOfAmt06v*********************uPx33lKL"

```

After completing the previous steps, execute the following command: `fly launch --ha=false`.

Choose "N" for the following two options.

- Would you like to set up a Postgresql database now? N
- Would you like to set up an Upstash Redis database now? N

Choose the region that is closest to you:

## Configuring MQTT Server for Your Toy

If the firmware version of your toy is v23.50.3.10 or later, follow these steps to configure the toy:

* Put the toy into configuration mode.
* Connect your phone or computer to the toy.
* Fill in the following information for MQTT:

   - MQTT Server Address: folotoy-server-test.fly.dev
   - MQTT Server Port: 1883

If the firmware version of your toy is earlier than v23.50.3.10, you need to update the firmware to the latest version or install the following configuration and re-publish the program:

* Log in to the flyio backend and find the IP address of the service. For example, my IP address is 149.*.*.218.

   ![image](https://github.com/FoloToy/folotoy-doc/assets/1455685/1e440c6a-1ebd-4c08-b812-c9ff7dc03155)

  After modifying the fly.toml file,

  replace

   ```
   SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_HOST = "folotoy-server-test.fly.dev"
   ```

   with

   ```
   SPEECH_UDP_SERVER_HOST = "149.248.197.218"
   ```

. Save the file and execute `fly launch --ha=false` in the command line.
